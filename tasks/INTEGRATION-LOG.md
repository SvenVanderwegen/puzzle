# Integration log (lead agent)

## 2026-07-03 — WS-02 merged
- Branch worktree-agent-a639a0a7ec22e4f6c @ 3dddae4 → merged after independent
  verification (PASS; mutation-tested crosscheck, teeth-tested API parity,
  independently measured 99.33% coverage / 26.8ms / 2.4s).
- Lead rulings on verifier flags: (1) determinism enforcement = vitest grep test
  ACCEPTED and additionally hardened with an ESLint no-restricted-properties rule
  for engine+game-core src (applied in this merge); (2) codec bounds 1..64
  ACCEPTED (contract silent; product max is 12); (3) CODEMAP row applied;
  (4) generate() regime note recorded: avoid breaks ≈ n/3 on narrow grids —
  product tiers (5×5/4, 6×6/8, 7×7/12) unaffected.
