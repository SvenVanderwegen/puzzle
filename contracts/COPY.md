# COPY.md — voice guide + canonical strings (FROZEN after ADR-0011)

Every user-facing string in `apps/` loads from the keyed catalog below through one
keyed-strings module (WS-09). EN only at launch; NL later is a translation file, not
a refactor. Keys are stable identifiers — changing a key is a contract change;
changing EN wording of an existing key is a normal PR.

## Voice

Calm night-shift dispatcher writing an incident report. Short declaratives, second
person, present tense. Numbers are facts, not celebrations.
**Lexicon:** contain, dispatch, incident, terrain, survey, crew, burn order,
wavefront, shift. **Banned:** fire puns ("hot streak", "you're on fire"),
exclamation marks in system copy, "awesome/great/well done", emoji outside the
share card. Dailies are titled **Incident #N**.
Interpolations use `{braces}`. Pluralization via ICU MessageFormat where marked.

## app

- `app.title` — Burnfront
- `app.tagline` — Every board is provably fair.
- `app.eyebrow` — Incident report · deduction puzzle

## rules (verbatim from the genre spec; shown on /rules and in the Academy)

- `rules.1` — **Shade exactly {n} firebreaks.** The ★ and the numbered cells are never breaks.
- `rules.2` — **Fire spreads one cell per minute.** It starts on the ★ at minute 0 and moves up, down, left and right — never diagonally, never through a break.
- `rules.3` — **Everything else burns.** Every cell that isn't a firebreak must be reached by the fire eventually. No safe pockets.
- `rules.4` — **Numbers are exact arrival times.** A cell marked 5 caught fire at minute 5 — not before, not after.
- `rules.note.distance` — A cell's minute is the length of the fire's shortest open route from the ★ — never less than the straight-line distance.
- `rules.note.aha` — Bigger than the distance? Something is in the way.
- `rules.note.wavefront` — Neighboring burnt cells differ by at most one minute; a cell burning at minute t caught it from a neighbor that burned at t−1.
- `rules.note.witnessed` — Every firebreak earns its place: if it were open, the fire would reach at least one numbered cell ahead of schedule.
